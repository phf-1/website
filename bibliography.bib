The key argument uses the Activity Lemma (Lemma 4.2) to establish the sequential nature of reduction, proving that non-sequential parallel evaluation violates the deterministic operational semantics (see especially pages 236--238 and the discussion of parallel features). This is the original and most cited source for the undefinability of parallel-or in PCF/lambda-calculus-based languages.}
