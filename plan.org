*** TODO Ma

actors should ask surrounding context — /i.e./ a Ma instance — for functionalities. For
instance, =ma#parse-binary(str)=. If parser ∈ ma, then ma#parse-binary(str) =
parser#parse-binary(str). In other words, an actor may ask its surrounding
environment for help. The question is when should an actor internalize a
functionality — /e.g./ parser — and when to ask its context for it — /e.g./
ma#binary-type(str) ? In other words, if an actor needs to be updated so that it can
use #binary-type(str) then should the actor:
1. Build its own internal parser ?
   - ⇒ no interface changes
2. Ask at build time for a parser ?
   - actor#mk() ↦ actor#mk(parser)
3. Ask its surrounding environment for #binary-type(str) ?
   - ma#binary-type(str) (ultra late biding)

**** Response
#+begin_example
This is a classic architectural trade-off involving **coupling, cohesion, and lifecycle management**. Choosing between internalizing a capability or externalizing it to the environment depends on how "essential" that functionality is to the actor's identity.

Here is a breakdown of how to choose between your three strategies:

---

### Comparison of Strategies

| Strategy | Coupling | Flexibility | Maintenance Overhead | Best For... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Internalization** | None (Self-contained) | Low (Hard-coded) | High (Duplication risk) | Core, unique logic. |
| **2. Build-time Injection** | Explicit | High (Swappable) | Medium (Interface changes) | Specific collaborators. |
| **3. Context Lookup** | Implicit (Magic) | Ultra-high | Low (Global updates) | Cross-cutting utilities. |

---

### When to use each approach

#### 1. Internalize (The "Loner" Actor)

Choose this if the functionality is **intrinsically tied** to the actor’s state or is a private implementation detail that no one else should care about.

,* **Logic:** If the parser logic is unique to *only* this actor and changing it elsewhere would break this actor, keep it inside.
,* **Math Logic:** .

#### 2. Build-time Injection (The "Contractor" Actor)

Choose this when the actor needs a specific tool to do its job, but you want the ability to swap that tool out (e.g., for testing or different binary formats).

,* **The Trade-off:** You mentioned "interface changes." While `actor#mk() \mapsto actor#mk(parser)` is a breaking change, it makes the dependency **explicit**. You avoid "magic" behavior where an actor fails at runtime because the environment is missing a piece.
,* **Use case:** When different actors need different *versions* of a parser.

#### 3. Context Lookup (The "Socialite" Actor)

This "Ultra-late binding" is powerful but risky. It treats the `Ma` instance as a **Service Locator**.

,* **Logic:** Use this for **cross-cutting concerns**—functionalities that are ubiquitous, stable, and used by almost every actor (like logging, time, or standard type-checking).
,* **The "Ma" Rule:** If  is a platform standard, the actor shouldn't have to carry the weight of that logic.
,* **Danger:** If the environment changes, the actor might break silently. It is harder to unit-test an actor if it requires a full `Ma` instance to function.

---

### The Decision Matrix

To decide which path to take, ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Is the parser a "Standard Utility"?** * *Yes:* Use **Option 3** (Context). Let the environment handle the heavy lifting.
2. **Does the actor's behavior change based on the parser type?** * *Yes:* Use **Option 2** (Injection). This ensures the actor is configured correctly at birth.
3. **Is the parser logic "Top Secret" or highly specialized?** * *Yes:* Use **Option 1** (Internal). Don't leak private logic into the environment.

> **Pro Tip:** If you want the best of both worlds, use **Option 2** but provide a **default** in the constructor that pulls from the environment. This keeps the interface explicit but the usage convenient.

Would you like me to help you draft a specific interface or "contract" for how the Actor should communicate its requirements to the `Ma` instance?

**** Objective

**** Result

Refactored js.

**** Log

A type A is a representation of some intuition. For instance, Point (type) represents
all points (intuition). An single point is represented by a pair of coordinates, x
and y (intuition). So, we define point : Point :≡ Point#mk(x y) (type
constructor). point#x :≡ x and point#y :≡ y. The invariant is that all points are a
pair of coordinates (intuition). In other words Point :≡ X × Y (type). Two points are
the same if they have the same coordinates (intuition). In other words Point#eq(p1
p2) :≡ (p1#x = p2#x ∧ p1#y = p2#y) (type). To use a point is to start from a point,
compute something and get a result (intuition). So, Point#use(proc) :≡ point ↦
proc(point#x point#y) (type).

So, a type is defined iff the type states what it represents and how to build/use its
instances. Since types may use other types, they for a partially ordered graph which
can be topologically sorted into a list: [T1, T2, …, Tn] called the /context/.

A type A can be viewed as a program that provide at least these functionnalities: how
to build, use, and compare datastructures. It also has documentation that describes
what it represents. An example may be given to ease the understanding.

#+begin_src typescript
/**
 ,* A Check is a function Any → Undefined such that if a value x does not verify some         // what it represents
 ,* invariant, then an error is raised.
 ,*
 ,* For instance, given point : Check, then point(x) = undefined means that x is a            // example
 ,* point /i.e./ has been built using a Point constructor.
 ,*
 ,* [[id:fb8e2f12-4097-4490-93e9-439d2da24b17]]                                               // address
 ,*/
class Check {
  static mk(pred, msg) { return new Check(pred, msg); }                                      // constructor

  #pred; #msg;
  constructor(pred, msg) {
    this.#pred = pred
    this.#msg = msg
    const callable = (x) => {
      if(pred(x)) { return undefined; }
      throw new TypeError(msg + `. x = ${x}`);
    }
    Object.setPrototypeOf(callable, Check.prototype);
    return callable
  }

  get pred() { return this.#pred; }
  get msg() { return this.#msg; }

  static use(proc) { return (check) => proc(check.pred, check.msg); }                        // eliminator

  // c1 === c2 is implicit                                                                   // equality
}

Check.Symbol = Check.mk((x) => typeof x === 'symbol', 'not a Symbol')                        // Symbol : Check
Check.String = Check.mk((x) => typeof x === 'string' || x instanceof String, 'not a String') // String : Check
Check.Integer = Check.mk((x) => Number.isInteger(x), 'not a Integer')                        // Integer : Check
Check.HTMLElement = Check.mk((x) => x instanceof HTMLElement, 'not a HTMLElement')           // HTMLElement : Check
#+end_src

Since any program can be viewed as an Actor, then mathematical types may be
represented as actors. For instance, the word =Point= is viewed as the address of the
actor that represents the Point type. =Point#mk(x y)= is viewed as sending the message
=mk(x y)= to =Point=. =point#x= is viewed as sending the message =x= to =point=.

The objective is to expose a webserver behind a reverse proxy to the internet. An
HTTP request goes to from the internet to the reverse proxy, is being forwarded to
something like localhost:3000. The request is processed by the webserver, a reply is
processed replied to the client through This process may be understood as an Actor
/i.e./ it can send/receive messages, has processing capabilities, memory, and the
capacity to start other processes.
