#+TITLE: Guile Personal Website

A flexible, reproducible personal website built entirely with GNU tools:

- Guile Scheme (actor-model architecture)
- Org-mode + Emacs (literate content with citations)
- GNU Guix (reproducible environments)

*Live site:* https://phfrohring.com

** Highlights

- Modular actor-based design (Parser, Publication, Library, Server)
- Plain-text Org-mode sources exported on-demand
- Content-addressable UUID directories
- Single self-contained executable via =make dist=
- Minimalist: no database, no heavy frameworks
- Easy systemd deployment

** Quick Start (Development)

#+begin_src bash
make env          # Enter reproducible dev environment
make start PORT=3000  # Start server
#+end_src

Visit http://localhost:3000
