#+begin_abstract
Understanding is a dynamic process: definitions evolve as understanding deepens. To
capture this idea, we embrace principled ambiguity: an article is viewed as an
ordered sequence of definitions, examples, and refutations, all aimed at elucidating
a phenomenon. Individual definitions may be ambiguous, but the final set—formed by
the most recent version of each definition—contains no ambiguities, even as the
article preserves the path that led to that set.

* Introduction

Understanding requires definitions. Below we describe an incremental approach to
writing definitions through successive refinements. An article that aims to capture
the essence of a phenomenon is viewed as an ordered sequence of definitions,
refutations, extensions, and integrations. Each of these elements is marked by a
dedicated block to facilitate scanning of the article and is assigned a unique
identifier (UUID).

* Objective

Guide the construction of an article that seeks to capture an idea using clear and
appropriate definitions.

* Context

The following resources were used:
- Peter Scholze on definitions [cite:@Avigad_2021]
- The "rising sea" as described by A. Grothendieck [cite:@mclarty2003rising]
- Leslie Lamport on definitions: lessons from industry [cite:@batson2003high]
- Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge
  [cite:@popper1963conjectures]

* Definition

A *definition* introduces a new name together with its associated meaning. To make
definitions easy to locate, we present them using blocks that look as follows:

#+ID: 57c6a5f3-8b0f-46cc-9fc6-44eb52177808
#+begin_definition
<description> *NewName* <description>.
#+end_definition

* Example

A definition may be followed by an *example*, introduced using a block as follows:

#+ID: ac0c8e26-e9da-4181-9872-4534d1a929e7
#+begin_instance
Example of what we mean by NewName.
#+end_instance

* Refutation

A *refutation* demonstrates that, within a given context, the current definitions lead
to undesired or problematic consequences. It can therefore justify updating or
replacing those definitions. While a refutation itself may be lengthy, the block
highlights its key finding (and sometimes contains the refutation in full).

#+begin_refutation
<content>
#+end_refutation

* Extension

Definitions are introduced sequentially. If a definition /D2/ defines the same name as
a previous definition /D1/, then /D2/ replaces /D1/ from that point onward.

This mechanism supports the introduction of definitions through successive
refinements. Some properties of /D2/ may be inherited from /D1/, while others may
contradict /D1/ in certain respects. In other words, /D2/ *extends* /D1/.

* Integration

A definition /DN/ represents the accumulation of all prior refinements from /D1/ onward —
i.e., its *integration*. To avoid repeatedly reconstructing /DN/ from earlier
definitions, integrated versions are explicitly stated when necessary.

* Result

#+begin_example
Article :≡ List(Definition + Example + Refutation + Extension)
#+end_example

An article whose goal is to capture an evolving understanding of a subject can
proceed by adding sections that introduce, extend, or refine definitions. Definition
integration reduces the cognitive burden of reconstructing definitions from their
history of refinements. Examples illustrate how the definitions operate in practice.
Refutations motivate the addition or extension of definitions.
