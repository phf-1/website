#+TITLE: Automating legal procedures
#+DATE: 2025-10-27

* Abstract

This work explores the feasibility of automating parts of judicial debt recovery
procedures using modern AI and distributed systems. Millions of uncollected contracts
remain unresolved each year because legal enforcement costs exceed potential
recoveries. This feasibility study focuses on identifying the main technical
challenges of automating such procedures. Two demonstrators were developed: one for
automated data extraction using Google Gemini, achieving over 95% accuracy, and
another as a web application for simulating recovery procedures built on the Erlang
Virtual Machine. Results show that current AI and distributed architectures enable
building large-scale, low-cost systems capable of processing millions of legal cases
efficiently, which is worth investigating.

* Introduction

How can judicial procedures be automated? The question begins with exploring how
modern AI tools may transform the legal world. In 2024–2025, I met lawyer [[https://www.jeantet.fr/avocats/philippe-mallea][Philippe
Mallea]], and we discussed several use cases. It turns out that millions of contracts
remain unresolved because traditional methods are too costly.

Each year, large companies generate millions of breached contracts—especially in
sectors like mobile phone subscriptions or streaming services such as Netflix. Each
contract may represent hundreds of dollars in debt, adding up to hundreds of millions
per year.

Recurring costs also accumulate. For instance, managing paper contracts can cost
around half a million dollars annually for infrastructure and logistics—such as
document processing facilities in North Africa. On top of that, companies still pay
taxes on these unfulfilled contracts.

* Problem

The main issue is that enforcing these contracts through legal procedures is more
expensive than ignoring them. In North Africa, for example, the cost of pursuing
legal action exceeds the potential recovery. So, the challenge is to reduce the cost
of processing millions of contracts efficiently each year.

To illustrate, consider the following: given 10 million mobile phone contracts, how
can we identify those with a success probability above 80% and apply the legal
procedure for less than $100 per case?

Assuming all legal and procedural parameters are known, the problem can be divided
into three parts:
- *Prediction*: Build a system that estimates the probability of a successful legal
  outcome for each contract.
- *Operation*: Design a program that applies the legal procedure at a cost below $100
  per case.
- *Scale*: Ensure both prediction and operation systems can process millions of cases
  simultaneously.

* Feasibility study

Since this is an exploratory study, the goal was to identify the key technical
challenges a viable solution must address.

- *Extracting data from raw contracts.* The prediction problem reduces to extracting
  relevant data from contracts, recording case outcomes, and applying statistical
  models to predict success rates. Because no dataset of successful or unsuccessful
  procedures exists, the initial task was to extract structured information
  efficiently from sample contracts. In short: can modern AI systems extract contract
  data effectively?

- *Flexible architecture.* The operational problem becomes one of system design—how
  to integrate automation smoothly into existing legal workflows while remaining
  flexible for edge cases and adapting to the rapid evolution of AI technologies.

- *Reading and writing legal documents.* The most expensive operations are those
  requiring lawyers’ input—reading and drafting legal documents. Can modern AI
  systems automate these tasks reliably?

- *Robustness at scale.* A large-scale system must be resilient: component failures
  should not trigger cascading failures that halt millions of procedures. How can we
  build such a robust system?

At this stage, the goal was to show that building a program with these properties is
realistic. Demonstrators were developed to support the argument that such automation
is feasible.

* Solution

After obtaining a test dataset of contracts, two programs were developed.

The first program processed the dataset and extracted nearly all relevant data,
achieving over 95% accuracy. Two key findings emerged:
1. The choice of AI model is critical—Google Gemini performed best for this task.
2. Effective prompt engineering requires experience and extensive trial and error.

Error correction systems were also essential to handle occasional nonsensical outputs
from AI models.

The second program was a web application built with the Elixir language on the Erlang
Virtual Machine (VM). Through a simple web interface, a lawyer could simulate a
"discussion" aimed at advancing a recovery procedure. Given a contract, the
application would read documents provided by the lawyer, generate a legal document in
response, and request the next document to process. The application followed the
legal procedures described by our partner lawyers, who evaluated the accuracy of the
automatically generated documents.

The architectural question was resolved through the Actor model, as implemented in
the Erlang VM. This model met all requirements for a robust, scalable distributed
system, including communication with external actors—for example, reading court
websites to obtain updates on legal procedures.

The Erlang VM provides a battle-tested implementation of the Actor Model, which views
programs as networks of small computing entities called /actors/. An actor is similar
to a lightweight virtual computer that communicates only by sending messages. If one
fails, it does not affect its neighbors and can be restarted. The Erlang VM supports
millions of actors running concurrently across multiple physical machines, providing
the desired robustness and scalability.

* Results

- More than 95% of expected data can be extracted from raw contracts using Google
  Gemini.
- With enough examples, Google Gemini can draft convincing legal documents adapted to
  specific recovery procedures.
- The Erlang VM offers the scalability and robustness required for a production
  system.
- The Actor Model provides the flexibility needed to model complex systems of
  interrelated legal entities.

* Conclusion

This feasibility study demonstrates that automating parts of judicial debt recovery
is worth investigating. Modern AI systems such as Google Gemini can reliably extract
data and draft legal documents with minimal human intervention, and distributed
architectures provide the scalability and robustness needed for real-world
deployment. More challenges remain to be solved, but no technical impossibilities
have been discovered.
