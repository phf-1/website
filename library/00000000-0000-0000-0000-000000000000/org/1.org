Pierre-Henry — a software engineer with experience as a developer, manager, and
co-founder.

I’ve led projects such as modeling a [[href:/e4771178-cf50-4957-8763-2ac5faf36f49/html][nuclear reactor’s electrical network]], which led
to the creation of /Deeplinks/, a subsidiary of an industrial group. More recently, I
carried out a feasibility study on [[href:/ca648df2-f226-4920-9c48-bbb1d879f7cb/html][automating legal procedures]] using AI (Google
Gemini) and the Actor Model (Elixir/Erlang VM).

I hold an MS in Applied Mathematics from [[https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en][Ensimag]] and an MS in Physics
(Telecommunications, Radar) from the [[https://www.polito.it/en][Politecnico di Torino]]. The [[href:/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001/html][Articles]] section of
this website highlights other experiences and projects.
