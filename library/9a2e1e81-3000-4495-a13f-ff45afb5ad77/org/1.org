* Introduction

By analogy with an exothermic physical process, an /exovaloric/ social process is one
that generates more value, utility, or benefit than the resources it consumes—often
through cooperation or amplification. Since software development involves
collaboration and value creation, we introduce /ExoCode/: an exovaloric process
designed to create value through software production.

ExoCode draws inspiration from the C4.1 process[cite:@hintjens_c4] described in the
ØMQ Guide[cite:@hintjens_guide Chapter 6], but targets smaller groups (around a dozen
collaborators rather than hundreds). It aims to drastically reduce the number of
rules while preserving the essence of what makes C4.1 successful.

* Objective

ExoCode should:
- Preserve the most valuable aspects of the C4.1 process as described in the guide.
- Contain significantly fewer rules than C4.1.
- Be usable by a single developer.
- Be adoptable by a new developer in under an hour.

* ExoCode

ExoCode is the process used by this project to update its code. When in doubt, refer
to the C4.1 process[cite:@hintjens_c4].

* License

The project uses a share-alike license such as:
- MPLv2[cite:@mplv2]
- LGPLv3[cite:@lgplv3]
- GPLv3[cite:@gplv3]

* Platform

The /platform/ is where the code is hosted — e.g. github.com, codeberg.org.

* Issue

An issue is created using the platform’s issue tracker. It consists of an assertion
and a predicate that must be true for a patch to be considered a solution.

* Patch

A patch is a Git commit containing data intended to be added to the project.

* Valid patch

A valid patch is a patch such that it:
- Solves one issue.
- Follows the project’s code style.
- Adheres to the Evolution of Public Contracts[fn:393a].
- Uses the same license as the project.
- Is owned by its author; no copyright assignment required.
- Does not include non-trivial code from other projects unless the contributor is the
  original author.
- Compiles cleanly and passes project self-tests on all main target platforms.
- Contains a commit message composed of:
  - An assertion as the first line.
  - A blank line.
  - An explanation of why the patch makes that assertion true.
- Updates the relevant documentations.
- Does not break the master branch when merged.

* Contributor

From a contributor’s point of view — /i.e./ someone who wishes to submit a patch to the
project — the process is:

1) Log in to the platform with your real name or well-known alias.
2) Add or choose an issue to solve in the issue tracker.
3) Fork the project.
4) Build a patch that solves the issue.
5) If you are not listed as a contributor, identify yourself.
6) Submit a pull request.
7) After the pull request is merged by a maintainer, close the issue.

* Maintainer

From a maintainer’s point of view — /i.e./ someone who reviews and merges patches — the
process is:

1) Log in to the platform with your real name or well-known alias.
2) Select a pull request.
3) Verify that the patch is valid.
4) If the patch is invalid, explain why to the author and:
   - either return to step 3;
   - or reject the pull request.
5) If the patch is valid, merge it into the "master" branch.

* Administrator

From an administrator’s point of view — /i.e./ someone who manages maintainers — the
process is:

1) Promote the most effective maintainers to administrators.
2) Remove inactive maintainers.
3) Ban "bad actors" after public discussion.

* Founder

From a founder’s point of view — /i.e./ someone who created the project and/or is its
moral owner — the process is:

1) Act as an administrator.

* Discussion

ExoCode has far fewer rules than the C4.1 process but refers to it in case of doubt.
Experience will show whether it fulfills its goals. Most importantly, it requires at
least one project and one entity — similar to iMatix as described in the Guide — to
hold a trademark and enforce the license. Until then, it cannot be put to the test.

* Conclusion

ExoCode may serve as a draft for a simpler C4.1 process but cannot surpass it unless
adopted by a project with significant stakes.
